# PDE
These codes solve, with the finite difference method, the equations of heat and waves (in one and two spatial dimensions). For the heat there is a heated bar which cools to a uniform temperature; for the waves, in one dimension there is an elastic rope with fixed ends, in two dimensions it is the mambrana of a rectangular drum.
There is also an animation of the solution.
